## Parts of the jumper

+ Open the starter project [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/181128260/#editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/181128260/#editor) - shortlink this!

+ Take a look at the sprites in the project - you have one sprite for each of the four parts which make up the jumper, and a button sprite.

+ Click on the jumper sprite and look at the Costumes tab. You will see three coloured costumes and a white "none" costume.

+ If you like, you can use the fill tool to change the colours of the costumes. Change the name of the costume too so that it matches the new colour.

+ Make sure you leave the **none** costume at the end, and make sure it is plain white. The white costume is shown when the player is trying to remember the jumper.

+ You can change the colours or pictures on all four sprites which make up the jumper if you want to - these are the sprites `jumper`, `stripes`, `trim` and `picture`.
