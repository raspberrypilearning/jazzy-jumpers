## Parts of the jumper

+ Open the [starter project](http://jumpto.cc/jazzy-go). 

+ Take a look at the sprites in the project: you have one sprite for each of the four parts which make up the jumper and one button sprite.

+ Click on the `jumper` sprite and then on the Costumes tab. You will see three coloured costumes and a white "none" costume.

+ If you like, you can use the **fill** tool to change the colours of the costumes. Change the names of the costumes too so that they match the new colours.

+ However, make sure to leave the "none" costume at the bottom, and make sure it is completely white. This costume is shown when the player is trying to remember the jumper.

+ If you want to, you can change the colours or pictures of all sprites which make up the jumper â€” these are the sprites `jumper`, `stripes`, `trim`, and `picture`.
